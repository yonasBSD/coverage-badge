## Quick Start

Add this step to your workflow after running your coverage tool:

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage badge
  uses: yonasBSD/coverage-badge@v1
  with:
    coverage: ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.percentage }}
    output: assets/coverage.svg
    commit: true
```

That's it! The action generates the badge and commits it to your repo. Then reference it in your README:

```markdown
![Coverage](assets/coverage.svg)
```
